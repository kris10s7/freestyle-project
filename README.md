# freestyle-project
This project builds on top of the Robo Advisor project on market data exploration.

## Environment Setup

Create and activate a new Anaconda virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -n stocks-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate stocks-env
```

From within the virtual environment, install the required packages specified in the "requirements.txt" file:

```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

```sh
python app/robo_advisor.py
```

Follow the user input prompts to run the application.
